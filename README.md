## Basics

Use the dpad or the left stick to move around. The right stick allows you to store/switch sheilds.

Press 🅐 to jump.

Press 🅐+🠉 to disengage a vehicle.

## Modes

### Single player

Self explanatory...

### 2-Player P2P Network Play

Serverless P2P network play is provided via WebRTC, so you'll need to exchange some tokens before you can start a game.

Select "direct connect" from the main menu, have one player select "Host Game" and the other select "Join Game".

Using the messaging service of choice, the joining user must first send the request token to the hosting user, must reply with an accept token. Once the users have exchanged and input their tokens, the game clients will connect.

Player 1 will be Sonic, player 2, tails. This is in extreme alpha.

### n-Player Server Play

Chaos Emeralds (will) power Super Transforms. In the current version, this restriction is not in place. Press 🅨/△ to access the super-state.

Some blocks some can be pushed, some are structural and make up floors, walls or ceilings. Some will break off fall when tread on, even lightly. Keep an eye out.

Try a bounce attack on falling blocks.

### Starposts

Starposts (will) record start/end times in the courses of Zones. They'll also store your checkpoint times, and distribute powerups.

### Switches

Switches can be activated by jumping, or depressing them with blocks. They'll activate various objects or environmental effects in all different places.

### Springs

Springs will shoot the character in whatever direction they're pointing, which includes straight up. Red ones are stronger.
